OroCRM Bridge Magento Extension
=============

The OroCRM Bridge extension improves on the Magento SOAP API v2 to expose additional shopping cart and customer data. These additional improvements allow companies to see:

- List of active shopping carts
- List of newsletter subscribers
- List of viewed products
- Customer wish list information

The OroCRM Bridge is recommended for better integration between OroCRM and Magento. It can also be used for other integrations that require an API for the features listed.
